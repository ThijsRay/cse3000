# Gender bias in different languages
This repository contains all the files that were used while doing the
CSE3000 Research Project at Delft University of Technology. All
document that were created for presentations and deliverables can
be found in the [docs](https://github.com/ThijsRay/cse3000/tree/master/docs) folder.
All the source code that was used to calculate the results can be found
in the [src](https://github.com/ThijsRay/cse3000/tree/master/src) folder.

## Requirements 
To run the code, ensure that you have Python 3.8 and R 4.0
installed. The calculation needs a lot of memory, in the order of tens to hundreds of gigabytes.
The dependencies for the Python code can be found in
[requirements.txt](https://github.com/ThijsRay/cse3000/blob/master/src/requirements.txt).
The dependencies for the R code are `hyperSMURF`, `dplyr`, `data.table`, `doParallel` and `radiant.data`.
