\section*{Background of the research}
In this section you should give some background to your research area. 
What is the problem you are tackling, and why is it worthwhile solving? 
What relevant literature are you going to read in week 1 to answer the following questions?
\begin{enumerate}
\item Who has already done some work in this area, what have they achieved, and how did they do this?
\item What is still missing? This may be much more complex / far into the future than your contribution.
\end{enumerate}
Give references in a reference section.

\section*{Research Question}
In this section you'll eventually need to state explicitly the hypothesis you aim to test or the deliverable that you are aiming for, and argue why this is a reasonable hypothesis to test.
What do you need to do in week 1 and 2 to make this more concrete?

\section*{Method}
In this section you should outline how you intend to go about accomplishing the aims you have set in the previous section. 
For now, list some possible tools/software/data that may be relevant for you and that you will need to choose from in the first two weeks.

\section*{Planning of the first two weeks}
Arrange meetings with relevant people in the first two weeks (e.g.\ responsible professor, supervisor, peer students, other people in the research group, potential users of your research).
Summarize your main tasks for the first two weeks, resulting in the submission of a more detailed research proposal.
