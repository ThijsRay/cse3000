Which part of your paper did you write?
- I wrote a part of my methodology. I assumed that this is a broader outline of the design
goals of my experiment.

What went well?
- Because I have been writing and thinking a lot about the methodology, it was
a smooth process to write the methodology.

What was difficult or unclear? Ask questions. These will be answered in the virtual classroom (session 3).
- It was fairly difficult to stick to a single line of thought during the writing process. Besides that, it was difficult to avoid getting into too much implementation details.
