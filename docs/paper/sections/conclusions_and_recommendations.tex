\section{Conclusion}
It was shown that word embeddings of different languages have a bias towards gender and
that they are generally more biased towards \emph{male} than towards \emph{female}.
There are some languages that seem to more biased towards \emph{female} and the
recommendation is that future research should focus on those languages in order to
understand why those language seem to be more biased towards \emph{female}. Figuring out
why this is the case, can lead to the development of novel debiasing algorithms that
are crucial in certain applications where gender bias in word embeddings should be
avoided.
