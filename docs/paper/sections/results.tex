\section{Results} \label{ch:results}
%The results are divided in two sections. The first section looks into
%the results of the uniform weighting method and the second section focuses on 
%the frequency weighting method. Each section addresses the results of the
%permutation test from formula \eqref{eq:setup_p_test}. We will also take a look
%at the effect size $d$s and means of each method.

\subsection{Uniform weighting method}
The permutation test has been performed on the uniform weighting method and it showed that
all 26 languages have a \mbox{\emph{p} value < $\alpha$}, and are
therefore significant, with respect to
the dummy language described in section~\ref{seq:dummy_language}. 
Therefore, the null hypothesis, defined in section~\ref{sec:hypothesis_test},
is rejected for all of the tested languages when
the uniform weighting method is used.

In figure~\ref{fig:effect_size} the effect size $d_1$ is shown for each language for the
uniform weighting method.
Finnish has the highest positive $d_1$ of all the tested languages, indicating that,
on average,
Finnish words have the highest association with \emph{male} of all the tested languages.
On the other hand, Basque has the highest negative $d_1$ of all the tested languages,
showing that Basque words, on average, have the strongest relation with \emph{female} of
all the tested languages.
16 out of 26 of the tested languages have a positive effect size $d_1$, which demonstrates that most of
the languages have a stronger link with \emph{male} than \emph{female} when this
is calculated with the uniform weighting method.

Figure~\ref{fig:mean_difference} presents the mean of the cosine distance and it
shows a similar result to figure~\ref{fig:effect_size}. Again, 16 out 26 of the languages
have a positive value, which leads to the same observation as in
figure~\ref{fig:effect_size}. In figure~\ref{fig:mean_difference}, Hungarian has the most 
association with \emph{male} and Hindi has the most association with \emph{female}.

\subsection{Frequency weighting method}
The permutation test has also been performed on the frequency weighting method,
which showed that 16 out of 26 languages have a \mbox{\emph{p} value < $\alpha$} with respect to
the dummy language described in section~\ref{seq:dummy_language}. This is deemed
significant and the null hypothesis can be rejected for these languages.

The 10 languages that have a \mbox{\emph{p} value > $\alpha$} and their respective \emph{p} values
are shown in table~\ref{tab:p-values-frequency}. The null hypothesis can \emph{not}
be rejected for these languages.

        method}

            {\small \textit{Note:} All languages with \emph{p} value < $\alpha$ are not

        \end{tablenotes}
    \end{threeparttable}
\end{table}

Figure~\ref{fig:weffect_size} shows the effect size $d_2$ of each language for the
frequency weighting method.
Burmese has highest positive $d_2$ of all the tested languages, indicating that
the most used words in Burmese have the highest link with \emph{male} of all the
tested languages.
Greek has the highest negative effect size $d_2$ of all the tested languages, indicating that
the most used words in Greek have the strongest relation with \emph{female} of all the
tested languages.

Figure~\ref{fig:sum_weighted} displays the weighted mean of the cosine distance for
the frequency weighting method. 15 out of 16 of the significant languages have a positive
value, which leads to the same observation made for figure~\ref{fig:weffect_size}. 

The overall result is similar for both methods. A notable
difference is that there are more languages that have a positive effect size $d_2$ in
figure~\ref{fig:weffect_size} than $d_1$ in figure~\ref{fig:effect_size}. This means
that the most used words of the tested languages are more associated
with word \emph{male} than all of the words in the language are.

    described in section~\ref{seq:dummy_language}, the effect size is a metric of whether
