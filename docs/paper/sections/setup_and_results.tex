\section{Setup}
The results were calculated on a machine with 10 CPU cores with 512 GB of
memory. The program calculates the results by first downloading
the required pre-trained word embeddings created by \textcite{grave2018learning}. 
For each downloaded language, the words \textit{male} and \textit{female} have been
translated beforehand.
The vectors associated with the translated words \textit{male} and \textit{female} are
extracted from the word embedding. Then, the cosine similarity is calculated
according to the methodology.

The code used to calculate the results can be found on 
GitHub\footnote{Git repository can be found on \url{https://github.com/ThijsRay/cse3000}} 
and was run with Python version 3.8.2 with R version 4.0.0.
