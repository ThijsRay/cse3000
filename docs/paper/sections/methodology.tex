\section{Methodology}
Traditional methods often use a modest set of words to determine the 
gender bias in a language. The downside of this approach is that it is
difficult to scale to more than one language. Not all words have an
equivalent translation into other languages and the words that are
included in this set are also chosen with some form of bias in mind.

This is reason why the only two variables that

The languages were chosen based on their a few critera. First, a pre-trained 
model for the languages should be available on https://fasttext.cc/docs/en/crawl-vectors.html.
Second, the language should be part of a family as listed on https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Language_family.
Third, the language can be translated with the help of DeepL or Google Translate.

This resulted 26 languages from 16 different language families. An overview of these languages, their
language families and translations
